    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "q1": "How is Astra different from Slack + Jira + Notion?",
    "a1": "Those tools were designed for individual jobs. Astra was designed as one unified OS. Chat messages become tasks. Documents link bidirectionally to execution cards. Metrics flow automatically. There's no context switching because everything lives in the same spatial workspace.",
    "q2": "Does Astra replace our existing tools?",
    "a2": "For most teams, yes — over time. Astra covers chat, task management, documentation, and engineering metrics in one platform. During transition, we integrate with GitHub, Slack, and Jira so you can migrate at your own pace.",
    "q3": "How does Flow Mode work technically?",
    "a3": "Flow Mode alters the interface at the rendering level. Sidebars animate away, notification listeners are suspended, and only your active task is displayed. Incoming messages are queued server-side and delivered in a batch when you exit Flow Mode.",
    "q4": "Is my data secure?",
    "a4": "Absolutely. All data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Enterprise plans include SOC 2 Type II compliance, SSO via SAML, and custom data retention policies. We never train AI models on your data.",
    "q5": "What AI capabilities are included?",
    "a5": "Every plan includes AI querying via the ⌘K Omni-Bar. The AI can search across all your departments' channels and documents to provide contextual summaries, risk signals, and priority suggestions. Enterprise plans get dedicated AI instances."
