# Module 0: Discovery & Beachhead Definition (Phase 0)

**Orbit Stage:** Foundation
**Goal:** Define the exact target audience experiencing visceral pain from tool fragmentation, and map out the minimum viable flow of the system.

## Key Objectives
1. **Ultra-Clear Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**
   *   Target Team Size.
   *   Target Industry context.
   *   Current Stack footprint: Slack/Teams, Jira/ClickUp, Notion, GitHub/GitLab.
2. **Singular Priority Use Case**
   *   Identify the absolute most painful routine that fails consistently across the fragmented stack. Build strictly for this flow first.
3. **Map the Real-World Flow**
   *   End-to-end tracing constraint: From "A request enters the system" until "The work is delivered and reported."
4. **Navigable UI/UX Prototype**
   *   Build a high-fidelity prototype (in Figma or similar) connecting the flow logic.
5. **Axiomatic Value Messaging**
   *   Refine the market positioning. We are not selling a "Task Manager." We are selling a "Productivity Operating System (OS)."
