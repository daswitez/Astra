# Module 1: Astra Core (Native Channels + Execution)

**Orbit Stage:** Foundation
**Goal:** The beating heart of the OS. Astra doesn't just integrate with your chat; it **is** your chat. If the core experience isn't lightning-fast and hyper-connected globally, the platform dies here.

## Fundamental Module 1: The Unified Native OS

The MVP must seamlessly blend standard task tracking with intuitive, Slack-like native communications for every single department in the organization.

### Key Features & Scope

1. **Organizational Architecture (Workspaces)**
   *   Hierarchy: Organization → Departments → Projects.
2. **Native Departmental Channels**
   *   *The Slack/Teams replacement.* Every department intuitively creates its own internal channels, completely native to the Astra ecosystem:
   *   **General Channel**: Reserved strictly for company-wide information and executive announcements. Every department shares this exact same global channel to ensure total organizational alignment.
   *   **Information Channel**: Read-only core documentation, wikis, and SOPs.
   *   **Notification Channel**: Automated system alerts from CI/CD, marketing deployments, or HR triggers.
   *   **Chat Channel**: Synchronous departmental discussions and quick, casual communication.
   *   **Storage Channel**: The ultimate repository for unstructured intel. This is where native brainstorming, flowcharts, whiteboards, and unstructured documents created in Astra are stored securely.
3. **Hybrid Document Engine**
   *   Documents and project briefs architected entirely around granular "blocks" seamlessly integrated into the Storage and Information channels.
4. **Task & Ticket Management**
   *   Core fields: State, Assignee, Dates, Priority.
   *   Minimum indispensable views: List format, Board format, and a basic Timeline context.
5. **Zero-Latency Text-to-Task Conversion**
   *   Long documents detailing new product specifications must possess the algorithmic capability to automatically convert into assignable task or ticket structures via a single command. 
   *   This completely eliminates the historical latency and dangerous information duplication.
6. **Maximum Dev & Org-UX**
   *   Ultra-low latency interface (<100ms response).
   *   Comprehensive global quick search.
   *   Relentless focus on keyboard-shortcut navigability.
