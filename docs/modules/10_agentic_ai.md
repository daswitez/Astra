# Module 10: Agentic AI (The Synthethic Workforce)

**Orbit Stage:** Outer Orbit
**Goal:** The endgame capability. Activated only after the platform has built impenetrable data density, standardized workflows, and earned total user trust. Transitioning from "AI that reads" to "AI that executes."

## Key Features & Scope

1. **Strategic Action Suggestion**
   *   Agents actively recommending and drafting cross-system actions (never executing critical operations randomly).
2. **Inter-Team Automation Orchestration**
   *   Routing complex ticket dependencies automatically across department silos (e.g., triggering QA handoffs seamlessly).
3. **Predictive Block Mitigation**
   *   Calculating the trajectory of sprint velocity and auto-suggesting task reassignments to prevent upcoming blockers.
4. **Verification Guardrails**
   *   Maintaining strict "Human-in-the-Loop" orchestration. Agents require simple explicit permission (confirmations) to commit highly destructive or outbound operations.
