**Orbit Stage:** Middle Orbit
**Goal:** Providing the infrastructure to scale product methodologies across varying departments without forcing users to reinvent the organizational wheel.

## Key Features & Scope

1. **Cross-Department Templates**
   *   Pre-configured workspace blueprints for Product, Operations, Support, Marketing, and QA.
2. **Ritual Playbooks**
   *   Standardized, guided doc formats for recurring agile rituals (Weekly Plannings, Retrospective Notes, Post-mortem Incident Reports).
3. **Constrained Customization**
   *   Allowing minimal, highly-controlled custom fields to accommodate unique team needs while avoiding turning the OS into an unmaintainable database Frankenstein.
