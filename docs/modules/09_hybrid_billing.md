# Module 9: Hybrid Billing & Pricing

**Orbit Stage:** Outer Orbit
**Goal:** Establishing a sophisticated monetization framework that handles global organizational adoption while protecting Astra from catastrophic cloud AI inference costs.

## Strategic Pricing Engineering & Corporate Business Model
The unit economics must be precisely calibrated to withstand the dramatic structural shifts in the global SaaS market. Moving the entire organization (with native chat, storage, and execution) onto Astra means pricing must clearly differentiate between solo explorers and massive enterprise adoptions.

### Hybrid Pricing Tiers
To execute a Product-Led Sales (PLS) strategy seamlessly alongside top-down organizational buy-in, Astra uses an Organization-Seat hybrid framework:

| Strategic Subscription Tier | Economic Pricing Structure | Functional Associated Value Proposition | AI Compute Cost Control Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Individual / Small Team Plan** | **Free "Freemium" acquisition model.** Strictly designed for individuals or tiny agile teams. | Fundamental task management, basic asynchronous docs, minimal channels. | **AI processing capabilities are totally excluded.** DORA telemetry extraction is manual. |
| **Organization Subscription (Seat-Based)** | **$15 - $25 per user/month, subscribed at the Organizational level.** | The core Astra experience. Deployment of full departmental chat/storage channels, SPACE & DORA analytics, deep Flow tools, and the cross-departmental AI Agent Querying capabilities across Storage Channels. | **Fixed volumetric allocation of monthly "AI compute credits."** Graceful degradation to lighter statistical language models if the organization exhausts its query limit, protecting against surprise overcharges. |
| **Enterprise-Tier / Corporate Deployment** | **Hybrid Structural Platform Fee + $45 - $65 Premium Licensing per user/month + Additional Metered Intelligent Consumption.** | Enablement of full Agentic AI orchestration, SAML SSO security, institutional regulatory data export, and edge hosting options. | **Pricing structure explicitly oriented toward predictive value recovery.** Pre-negotiated overages billed directly for massive volumes of autonomous operations (pure usage-based billing). |

If an organization wants to formalize their workspace securely across departments (Marketing, Engineering, HR, etc.) with dedicated internal chat channels and cross-departmental AI intelligence, they must subscribe and pay for seats. This framework addresses C-Level financial anxieties while securing robust organizational revenue.
