# Module 6: Automated Reports & Executive Visibility

**Orbit Stage:** Middle Orbit
**Goal:** Fulfilling the core promise to leadership: "You will never have to chase a developer for a status update meeting again." 

## Key Features & Scope

1. **Automated Weekly Digest**
   *   System-generated update logs formatted by team and project.
2. **Real-Time State Alignment**
   *   Aggregating exact progress, hard blocks, ticket dependencies, and current priority focus without human generation.
3. **'Director View' Portfolio**
   *   High-level health and velocity summaries organized by major business initiative or area, deliberately obfuscating individual micro-metrics to prevent behavioral abuse.
4. **Export & Sharing Mechanics**
   *   Standardized CSV/PDF reporting outputs.
   *   Secure Magic-Link generation for external stakeholder visibility.
