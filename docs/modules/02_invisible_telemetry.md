# Module 2: Invisible Telemetry (DORA + SPACE)

**Orbit Stage:** Inner Orbit
**Goal:** Transitioning Astra from "another tool" into an empirical executive dashboard system via algorithmic data abstraction, all without requesting manual data entry from devs.

## Fundamental Module 2: The Invisible Organizational Telemetry Engine
Demanding that the user manually log their time or progress has proven to be an unacceptable liability that destroys team morale. Instead, the MVP must possess the capability to authenticate and connect passively with the enterprise's pre-existing development infrastructure.

### Key Features & Scope

1. **Passive DORA Integration via APIs**
   *   Connect silently to secure APIs (GitHub, GitLab, and established CI/CD pipelines).
   *   Through this silent integration, the OS continuously extracts code validation events to dynamically calculate and display DORA metrics on managerial dashboards (Lead Time for Changes, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, and MTTR).
2. **Synchronous SPACE Micro-Surveys**
   *   Simultaneously and synchronously, the system will trigger asynchronous micro-survey workflows presented in-line and contextually within the platform (in-app pulse checks requiring no more than one click).
   *   These measure the vital psychosocial dimensions of collective well-being and collaborative friction prescribed by the SPACE framework.
3. **Aggregated Dashboards**
   *   Simple, compelling team/project views for PMs and EMs.
4. **Anti-Micromanagement Guardrails**
   *   Hardcoded narrative and UI boundaries presenting metrics strictly as "systemic bottlenecks" rather than elements for an individual performance whip.
