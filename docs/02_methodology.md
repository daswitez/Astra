# Scientific & Sociotechnical Methodology

Astra transcends standard task management by natively embedding scientifically proven frameworks into its architecture. It marries executive financial predictability with developer creative autonomy.

## 1. DORA Framework (System Health)
Originating from Google Cloud DevOps research, DORA quantifies systemic flow and technical stability rather than microscopically tracking human effort.
*   **Throughput Metrics**: 
    - **Deployment Frequency**: How often validated code enters production.
    - **Lead Time for Changes**: The exact temporal latency from code commit to user availability.
*   **Instability Metrics**: 
    - **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments causing interruptions.
    - **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: How fast the team successfully remediates failure.
*   **The Guardrail**: DORA is embedded natively to visualize cross-team bottlenecks, *never* to be weaponized for punitive micromanagement.

## 2. SPACE Framework (Human Health & Flow)
A multidimensional framework diagnosing the psychosocial reality behind the code. High visual activity often hides systemic friction.
*   **S**atisfaction and well-being.
*   **P**erformance (outcome impact and quality).
*   **A**ctivity (raw quantitative throughput).
*   **C**ommunication and collaboration (review latency, mentoring).
*   **E**fficiency and flow.
*   **The Guardrail**: Implemented via asynchronous, one-click, deeply integrated "micro-pulses." Astra cross-references this with DORA to predictably forecast burnout early.

## 3. Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD)
Corporate friction is inherently political. Astra explicitly recognizes that different layers of the organization "hire" software to do wildly divergent functional, emotional, and social jobs:
*   **Product Managers**: Need friction-free OKR alignment (Functional), anxiety reduction regarding deadlines (Emotional), and strategic perception (Social).
*   **Engineering Managers**: Need accurate velocity tracking without interrupting devs (Functional), control over technical debt (Emotional), and to be seen as a reliable shield for their team (Social).
*   **Individual Contributors (Devs)**: Need pure cognitive flow states (Functional), pride of craftsmanship (Emotional), and peer respect without managerial surveillance (Social).

Astra mediates this friction through **asymmetric data abstraction**: Developers work in distraction-free tactical execution environments, while the OS passively generates strategic executive layers upward.
